          <h4> At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</h4>
          <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a great way to pay for some thing that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT 
            bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="url">crafting an NFT</a> and by this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

          <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS Code screenshot we included by mistake.
             The eight lines of white text on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.<br>

          Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're selling them, not buying them.</p>
